# Robust-PCA-via-Non-convex-Half-quadratic-Regularization (RPCA-HQF)
In this paper, we propose a new non-convex regularization term named half-quadratic function to achieve robustness and sparseness for robust principal component analysis, and derive its proximity operator, indicating that the resultant optimization problem can be solved in computationally attractive manner.
